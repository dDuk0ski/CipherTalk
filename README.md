## Overview

CipherTalk uses a simple local TCP relay (on port 9000) to deliver AES-GCMâ€“encrypted messages and files between peers and groups. Users identify themselves with compact ID codes (Base58 strings bundling nickname, IP, port, and public key) for zero-configuration friend discovery.

---

## Features

â€¢ ID codes for frictionless friend discovery
â€¢ Private chats (text & `/send_file`)
â€¢ Group chats with per-group keys and auto-generated names
â€¢ Live online status (ðŸŸ¢/âšª) in your friend list
â€¢ Server panel showing active sessions & packet counts
â€¢ Quick-setup guide for IP discovery, port forwarding, and firewall

---

## Requirements

â€¢ Python 3.7+
â€¢ PyNaCl â‰¥ 1.4.0
â€¢ pycryptodome â‰¥ 3.9.0
â€¢ SQLAlchemy â‰¥ 1.3.0

Install with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quickstart

### 1) Launch & Set Nickname

Run:

```
python run.py
```

You'll see something like:

```
[Device] Identity already initialized.  
ðŸ”‘ Enter your nickname:  alice  
[ServerService] Listening on port 9000  
```

This starts your local relay on port 9000 and begins pinging friends every 30 seconds for online status.

---

### 2) Main Menu Options

After entering your nickname, youâ€™ll see:

```
=== Main Menu ===  
1) Generate ID code  
2) Add friend

```

Option descriptions:

1. **Generate ID code**
   Produce your Base58 ID (nickname, IP, port, public key). Share it so friends can add you.

2. **Add friend**
   Paste a friendâ€™s ID code to register them locally.

3. **Friend list**
   View all friends (sorted) with ðŸŸ¢/âšª online indicators.

4. **Chats**
   Choose a friend and enter a private chat loop.

5. **Create group chat**
   Pick multiple friends; auto-name group by joining nicknames; distribute per-group key.

6. **Server panel**
   Display your relayâ€™s active sessions and packet counts.

### 3) Private Chat

After choosing option 4, select a friend:

```
Your Friends:  
  ðŸŸ¢ bob @ 203.0.113.42:9000  
  âšª carol @ 198.51.100.17:9000  

Enter friend username (blank to cancel): bob  
```

In the chat loop you can:

â€¢ Type any message and press Enter
â€¢ Send a file with
/send\_file /full/path/to/file.ext
â€¢ Exit back to Main Menu with
/exit

All payloads are end-to-end encrypted and relayed via your local server.

---

### 4) Group Chat

1. Choose **5) Create group chat**
2. Enter a comma-separated list of friend usernames, e.g.
   alice,bob,charlie
3. CipherTalk will generate a random 256-bit group key, auto-name the group by joining member nicknames (e.g. alice\_bob\_charlie), and distribute the key securely to each member.

As the owner youâ€™ll relay group messages/files to all members; as a participant youâ€™ll receive and decrypt them.

---

### 5) Sending Files

â€¢ **Private Chat**: use `/send_file` inside the chat loop.
â€¢ **Group Chat**: after selecting your group chat in the group-chat loop, use the same `/send_file` syntax to share files.

---

â€¢ Logs folder: `~/.cipher_talk/logs/`
